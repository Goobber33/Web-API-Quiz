# Password Generator

 This is some of the first JavaScript I have written. This project was aimed to create a Password Generator, which gives an option to choose the length of 8 to 128 characters long. It gives prompts to add uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, and adds whichever the user selects to the randomly generated password.
